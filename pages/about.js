                <span className="details1">At Text we want to publish books 
                    that make a difference to people’s lives. We believe that reading should 
                    be a marvellous experience, that every book you read should somehow 
                    change your life if only by a fraction. We love the phrase ‘lost in a book’—
                    that’s where we want our readers to be. You can’t get lost in a newspaper 
                    or a magazine or even a movie. But people get lost in books every day—
                    on the tram, on the beach, in bed. Reading is what keeps the imagination 
                    supple and challenges preconceptions and prejudices. You read at your 
                    own speed, and the world you enter courtesy of the writer is yours and 
                    yours only, even if the person next to you on the bus is reading exactly 
                    the same book.
                                We are committed to providing first-class services to the writers 
                    who trust us with their books. If we are to fulfil our promises to readers, 
                    our job is to do everything in our power to help our writers write the best 
                    books they can. We care passionately about the quality of our editorial 
                    work. Design and production matter to us because we want our books to 
                    be beautiful objects. And since we want our beautiful books to be read on 
                    trains and beaches, in beds and planes, or under the desk at school and 
                    work, we work up a sweat to promote and market them. And that includes
                    selling rights on behalf of our writers to publishers all around the world. In 
                    fact we earn more money for our writers through licensing international 
                    editions than we do by turning their books into bestsellers in Australia and New Zealand.
